        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <p>At Conti Spares, we specialize in providing a wide range of used car parts to cater to your automotive needs. 
            Because our inventory consists of pre-owned items, we do not accept returns. 
            We encourage our customers to carefully review part descriptions and compatibility before making a purchase.
             Our experienced team is always available to assist you in selecting the right components for your vehicle. 
             By ensuring that you choose the right parts initially, we aim to deliver a seamless and satisfactory purchasing experience. 
            Thank you for understanding our policy!</p>
        <h3>How do I know if a part is compatible with my vehicle?</h3>
        <p>We provide detailed descriptions and specifications for each part listed on our website. 
            If you're unsure about compatibility, our knowledgeable staff is here to help. 
            You can contact us with your vehicle’s make, model, and year, and we’ll assist you in ensuring the part fits your needs. 
            Additionally, we recommend checking your vehicle's manual for specific part numbers to verify compatibility.</p>
